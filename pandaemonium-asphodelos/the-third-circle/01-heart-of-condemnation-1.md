# Pand√¶monium Asphodelos: The Third Circle (Savage)

## Heart of Condemnation #1
Two tethers will appear on two random party members.  When the mechanic resolves, heaving hitting AoEs will hit the two players who have the teathers.

To resolve this, the entire party will stack on teh **South West** flank of behind the boss.  Both tanks will then move in to grab a tether and take them to opposite sides of the boss.

The **Main Tank** will go left and the **Off Tank** will go right. 

The party needs to ensure they are standing still and not moving around until the tanks have the tethers.
